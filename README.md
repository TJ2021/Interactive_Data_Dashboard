# Interactive Data Dashboard
## About The Project

This project involves creating a candlestick chart to visualize stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) over a specified date range using data from Yahoo Finance.
The chart displays the open, high, low, and close prices for each day, providing a visual representation of stock price movements and trends. The project uses 
pandas_datareader to fetch the data, and bokeh to generate and display the interactive candlestick chart. The candlestick chart is an essential tool for technical 
analysis in stock trading, illustrating price trends and patterns over time.
